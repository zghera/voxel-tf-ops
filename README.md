# Point-Voxel CNN TensorFlow Voxel Ops
This repo holds the implementations for the voxel-related ops for [the TensorFlow 2 Implementation of Point-Voxel CNN for Efficient 3D Deep Learning](https://github.com/zghera/pvcnn-tf) (see [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03739), [MIT HAN Lab Repo](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/pvcnn)).

The original sections of the README as well as other default files from the [original custom-op repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/custom-op) were kept in the branch `original-files`.
